SODA Equal Experts Test

This code has a series of JUnit tests to test the requirements.  I wrote the tests before writing the code.
The junit tests fully exercise all of the relevant code.  I was aiming for an API that waas maximally simple
to use and met all of the requirements.

mvn test should run the code assuming you have JAVA_HOME configured to java 17.
The code might run under earlier JVMs with requsite changes to the POM.
